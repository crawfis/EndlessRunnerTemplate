# Contributing â€” Issue & Kanban workflow

This repository uses GitHub Issues + Projects v2 as a Kanban board. Follow these conventions when opening and working on issues.

- Use the Issue forms: choose either "User Story" or "Task" when creating new work.
- Titles: prefix with [Story] or [Task] and keep them short.
- Branches: create a branch per issue named: issue-<number>-short-description
- PRs: reference the issue in the PR description and use "Closes #<issue>" when the PR completes the work.
- Subtasks: create separate issues for assignable or estimable subtasks. Use checklists for trivial steps.
- Definitions:
  - Definition of Ready: clear acceptance criteria, estimate, no unknown blockers.
  - Definition of Done: unit tests, code review, documentation updated, and merged.

If you are not sure where to file something, open an issue in Backlog and tag it type:story or type:task.
