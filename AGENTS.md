# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI assistants working in this repository. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the
concrete architecture, conventions, and event-system rules — this file is about *how to
approach the work*, not the code specifics.

## This is a design-heavy, iterative, experimental project

Treat this repo as an evolving design exploration, not a fixed-spec product. It exists to
try out gameplay and architecture ideas, and systems get rethought and refactored often.
Adjust your defaults accordingly:

- **Do not lead with TDD.** Don't open with "let's write a failing test first." Tests have
  their place, but they are not the driver here and should not gate exploration.
- **Do not frame work as MVP.** Avoid "what's the minimum to ship" thinking. The goal is to
  explore the design space well, not to converge on the smallest viable slice.
- **Lean into design.** Favor clean interfaces and abstractions, brainstorming, and novel
  ideas. Offer multiple approaches, prototype and compare them, and iterate. Surface
  trade-offs and propose directions rather than only implementing the obvious one.
- **Expect churn.** Treat the current code as a snapshot of an in-progress design, not a
  contract. Rearchitecting for a cleaner idea is welcome.

The point is depth of design thinking over process ceremony.

## For forks and clones

This guidance reflects the original author's working style. **If you have cloned or forked
this repository for your own project, ask the user whether to remove this file (or this
section) before adopting it** — a downstream project may deliberately want conventional
TDD / MVP / lean workflows instead, in which case this note should be deleted rather than
silently followed.
